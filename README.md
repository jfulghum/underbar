This projects rewriting the underscore javascript library to better understand how each method works.
Here is a list of the functions from underscore.js that I rewrote for this project:
_.identity - Returns whatever value is passed as the argument Collections
_.first - Returns an array of the first n elements of an array _.last - Returns an array of the last n elements of an array _.each - Calls the iterator for each element of a collection (array or object) _.indexOf - Returns the index at which the target can be found in the array _.filter - Return all elements of an array that pass a truth test _.reject - Return all elements of an array that do not pass a truth test _.uniq - Produce a duplicate-free version of the array _.map - Return the results of applying an iterator to each element _.pluck - Takes an array of objects and returns an array of the values of a certain property in it _.reduce - Reduces an array or object to a single value _.contains - Determine if the array of object contains a given value _.every - Determine whether all of the elements match a truth test _.some - Determine whether any of the elements pass a truth test Objects
_.extend - Extend a given object with all of the properties of the passed in object(s) _.defaults - Like _.extend, but does not overwrite a key that already exists in the object Functions
_.once - Return a function that can be called at most one time _.memoize - Memorize an expensive function's results by storing them _.delay - Delays a function for the given number of milliseconds, and then calls it with the arguments supplied Advanced Collection Operations
_.shuffle - Randomizes the order of an array's contents Extra Credit
_.invoke - Calls the method named by functionOrKey on each value in the list _.sortBy - Sort the object's values by a criterion produced by an iterator _.zip - Zip together two or more arrays with elements of the same index going together _.flatten - Takes a multidimensional array and converts it to a one-dimensional array _.intersection - Takes an arbitrary number of arrays and produces an array that contains every item shared between all the passed-in arrays _.difference - Takes the difference between one array and a number of other arrays. Only the elements present in just the first array will remain
